## Project Description
This project serves as a mobile navigation app for visitors, students, and staff at Concordia University (Montreal), similar to Google Maps.
The app consists of 6 features, implemented throughout a 3-month semester, while following an Agile development methodology:
- Maps of the 2 campuses
- Outdoor directions (between buildings on campus)
- Directions to the building of the next class based off of their Google Calendar or Concordia class schedule
- Indoor directions from a selected building on either campus
- Directions to additional facilities within a building
- (Optional) A smart planner that creates a plan to execute all time-based tasks

The project uses React Native to create a cross-platform app and uses the Expo Go app to demonstrate complete mobile functionality via a QR code.

## Running the project
- **For Android users**: install the Expo Go app on the Google Play Store
- Create an Expo account or log in to your existing account
- With this repository cloned, go to the project's directory in the terminal and run the following commands
```
npx expo start -c
npx expo start
```
- Scan the generated QR code in the terminal with the Expo Go app for Android or the Camera app for iOS

If everything went well, you should see the mobile app working on your phone.
